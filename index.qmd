> This package provides efficient algorithms for Bayesian estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) models via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A wide range of SVAR models is considered, including homo- and heteroskedastic specifications and those with non-normal structural shocks. All models include three-level equation-specific local-global hierarchical prior distribution for the estimated level of shrinkage for autoregressive and structural parameters. Additionally, the package facilitates predictive and structural analyses with a variety of tools and methods.

> Efficient algorithms for Bayesian estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressions with Stochastic Volatility heteroskedasticity, Markov-switching and Time-Varying Identification of the Structural Matrix, and a three-level global-local hierarchical prior shrinkage for the structural and autoregressive matrices. The models were developed for a paper by Camehl & Woźniak (2023) *What do Data Say About Time-Variation in Monetary Policy Shock Identification?*
