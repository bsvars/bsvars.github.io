> Provides fast and efficient procedures for Bayesian analysis of Structural Vector Autoregressions. This package estimates a wide range of models, including homo-, heteroskedastic, and non-normal specifications. Structural models can be identified by adjustable exclusion restrictions, time-varying volatility, or non-normality. They all include a flexible three-level equation-specific local-global hierarchical prior distribution for the estimated level of shrinkage for autoregressive and structural parameters. Additionally, the package facilitates predictive and structural analyses such as impulse responses, forecast error variance and historical decompositions, forecasting, verification of heteroskedasticity, non-normality, and hypotheses on autoregressive parameters, as well as analyses of structural shocks, volatilities, and fitted values. Beautiful plots, informative summary functions, and extensive documentation including the vignette by [Woźniak (2024)](http://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.15090) complement all this. The implemented techniques align closely with those presented in [Lütkepohl, Shang, Uzeda, & Woźniak (2024)](http://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.11057), [Lütkepohl & Woźniak (2020)](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2020.103862), and [Song & Woźniak (2021)](http://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.013.174). The **bsvars** package is aligned regarding objects, workflows, and code structure with the **R** package **bsvarSIGNs** by [Wang & Woźniak (2025)](http://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.bsvarSIGNs), and they constitute an integrated toolset.

> Implements state-of-the-art algorithms for the Bayesian analysis of Structural Vector Autoregressions identified by sign, zero, and narrative restrictions. The core model is based on a flexible Vector Autoregression with estimated hyper-parameters of the Minnesota prior as in  [Giannone, Lenza, Primiceri (2015)](http://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00483). The sign restrictions are implemented employing the methods proposed by [Rubio-Ramírez, Waggoner & Zha (2010)](http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-937X.2009.00578.x), while identification through sign and zero restrictions follows the approach developed by [Arias, Rubio-Ramírez, & Waggoner (2018)](http://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA14468). Furthermore, our tool provides algorithms for identification via sign and narrative restrictions, in line with the methods introduced by [Antolín-Díaz and Rubio-Ramírez (2018)](http://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20161852). Users can also estimate a model with sign, zero, and narrative restrictions imposed at once. The package facilitates predictive and structural analyses using impulse responses, forecast error variance and historical decompositions, forecasting and conditional forecasting, as well as analyses of structural shocks and fitted values. All this is complemented by colourful plots, user-friendly summary functions, and comprehensive documentation including the vignette by [Wang & Woźniak (2025)](https://doi.org/10.48550%2FarXiv.2501.16711). The **bsvarSIGNs** package is aligned regarding objects, workflows, and code structure with the **R** package **bsvars** by [Woźniak (2024)](http://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.bsvars), and they constitute an integrated toolset. It was granted the Di Cook Open-Source Statistical Software Award by the Statistical Society of Australia in 2024.

> Efficient algorithms for Bayesian estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressions (VARs) with Stochastic Volatility heteroskedasticity, Markov-switching and Time-Varying Identification of the Structural Matrix, and a three-level global-local hierarchical prior shrinkage for the structural and autoregressive matrices. The models were developed for a paper by [Camehl & Woźniak (2025)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.19659) titled *Time-Varying Identification of Structural Vector Autoregressions*. The 'bsvarTVPs' package is aligned regarding objects, workflows, and code structure with the R packages 'bsvars' by [Woźniak (2024)](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.bsvars) and 'bsvarSIGNs' by [Wang & Woźniak (2025)](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.bsvarSIGNs), and they constitute an integrated toolset.

# bvarPANELs

> Provides Bayesian estimation and forecasting of dynamic panel data using Bayesian Hierarchical Panel Vector Autoregressions (VARs). The model includes country-specific VARs that share a global prior distribution. Under this prior expected value, each country's system follows a global VAR with country-invariant parameters. Further flexibility is provided by the hierarchical prior structure that retains the Minnesota prior interpretation for the global VAR and features estimated prior covariance matrices, shrinkage, and persistence levels. Bayesian forecasting is developed for models including exogenous variables, allowing conditional forecasts given the future trajectories of some variables and restricted forecasts assuring that rates are forecasted to stay positive and less than 100. The package implements the model specification, estimation, and forecasting routines, facilitating coherent workflows and reproducibility. Beautiful plots, informative summary functions, and extensive documentation complement all this. An extraordinary computational speed is achieved thanks to employing frontier econometric and numerical techniques and algorithms written in **C++**. The **bvarPANELs** package is aligned regarding objects, workflows, and code structure with the **R** packages **bsvars** by [Woźniak (2024)](http://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.bsvars) and **bsvarSIGNs** by [Wang & Woźniak (2025)](http://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.bsvarSIGNs), and they constitute an integrated toolset.
