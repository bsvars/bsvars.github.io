    "text": "We develop R packages for Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregressions using frontier econometric methods and compiled code written in cpp.\n                 \n\nbsvars\n\n\nAn R package for Bayesian Estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressive Models\nby Tomasz Woźniak\n      \nProvides fast and efficient procedures for Bayesian analysis of Structural Vector Autoregressions. This package estimates a wide range of models, including homo-, heteroskedastic, and non-normal specifications. Structural models can be identified by adjustable exclusion restrictions, time-varying volatility, or non-normality. They all include a flexible three-level equation-specific local-global hierarchical prior distribution for the estimated level of shrinkage for autoregressive and structural parameters. Additionally, the package facilitates predictive and structural analyses such as impulse responses, forecast error variance and historical decompositions, forecasting, verification of heteroskedasticity, non-normality, and hypotheses on autoregressive parameters, as well as analyses of structural shocks, volatilities, and fitted values. Beautiful plots, informative summary functions, and extensive documentation complement all this. The implemented techniques align closely with those presented in Lütkepohl, Shang, Uzeda, & Woźniak (2024), Lütkepohl & Woźniak (2020), and Song & Woźniak (2021). The bsvars package is aligned regarding objects, workflows, and code structure with the R package bsvarSIGNs by Wang & Woźniak (2024), and they constitute an integrated toolset.\n[CRAN] [website] [repo]\n\nPresentations\n[QuantEcon 2024-08 featuring bsvars 3.1 and bsvarSIGNs 1.0.1]\n[Monash University 2024-08 featuring bsvars 3.1 and bsvarSIGNs 1.0]\n[Workshops for Ukraine 2024-08 featuring bsvars 3.1]\n[Macroeconometrics students 2024-05 featuring bsvars 2.1.0]\n[Bayesian Econometrics students 2023-08 featuring bsvars 1.0.0]\n\n\n\nbsvarSIGNs\n\n\nAn R package for Bayesian Estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressions Identified by Sign, Zero, and Narrative Restrictions\nby Xiaolei Wang and Tomasz Woźniak\n      .\nImplements state-of-the-art algorithms for the Bayesian analysis of Structural Vector Autoregressions identified by sign, zero, and narrative restrictions. The core model is based on a flexible Vector Autoregression with estimated hyper-parameters of the Minnesota prior as in Giannone, Lenza, Primiceri (2015). The sign restrictions are implemented employing the methods proposed by Rubio-Ramírez, Waggoner & Zha (2010), while identification through sign and zero restrictions follows the approach developed by Arias, Rubio-Ramírez, & Waggoner (2018). Furthermore, our tool provides algorithms for identification via sign and narrative restrictions, in line with the methods introduced by Antolín-Díaz and Rubio-Ramírez (2018). Users can also estimate a model with sign, zero, and narrative restrictions imposed at once. The package facilitates predictive and structural analyses using impulse responses, forecast error variance and historical decompositions, forecasting and conditional forecasting, as well as analyses of structural shocks and fitted values. All this is complemented by colourful plots, user-friendly summary functions, and comprehensive documentation. The bsvarSIGNs package is aligned regarding objects, workflows, and code structure with the R package bsvars by Woźniak (2024), and they constitute an integrated toolset.\n[CRAN] [website] [repo]\nPresentations\n[QuantEcon 2024-08 featuring bsvars 3.1 and bsvarSIGNs 1.0.1]\n[Monash University 2024-08 featuring bsvars 3.1 and bsvarSIGNs 1.0]\n\n\n\n\nbsvarTVPs\n\nAn R package for Bayesian Estimation of Heteroskedastic Structural Vector Autoregressions with Markov-Switching and Time-Varying Identification of the Structural Matrix\nby Tomasz Woźniak and Annika Camehl\nEfficient algorithms for Bayesian estimation of Structural Vector Autoregressions with Stochastic Volatility heteroskedasticity, Markov-switching and Time-Varying Identification of the Structural Matrix, and a three-level global-local hierarchical prior shrinkage for the structural and autoregressive matrices.
