A wide range of SVAR models is considered, including homo- and heteroskedastic specifications and those with non-normal structural shocks. All models include three-level equation-specific local-global hierarchical prior distribution for the estimated level of shrinkage for autoregressive and structural parameters. Additionally, the package facilitates predictive and structural analyses with a variety of tools and methods.\n[CRAN] [website] [repo]"
